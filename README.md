# Peptide-Classification

Introduction:

The Peptide Classification project involved conducting thorough bioinformatics research and developing a machine learning model to discern whether a given antibacterial peptide also functions as an antibiofilm peptide. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was utilized to achieve a predictive accuracy of 78%.

Tools and Technologies:

Python
Scikit-Learn for model development and data preprocessing
Pandas for data handling
Seaborn for data visualization
Methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   
Identified and rectified issues related to missing data.
Normalized the features to ensure a consistent scale.
Addressed class imbalance to ensure fair representation of classes.
Visualized data distributions to gain insightful understanding using Seaborn.

2. Feature Selection:
   
Employed Scikit-Learn for effective feature selection to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.

3. Model Development (SVM):
   
Chose SVM due to its effectiveness in classification tasks, handling linearly and nonlinearly separable data, and capability to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces.
Utilized different kernel functions to map data into higher-dimensional space capturing complex nonlinear relationships.

4. Model Evaluation:

Achieved an accuracy of 78%, demonstrating a robust predictive power for distinguishing antibiofilm peptides.

Key Insights about SVM:

SVM operates by discovering an optimal hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates data points of distinct classes, maximizing the margin between the closest data points of each class from the hyperplane.
Its popularity in classification tasks stems from its effectiveness in both linear and nonlinear data separation, and adaptability to high-dimensional spaces.
Results and Future Directions:

The SVM modelâ€™s performance demonstrates a promising step towards leveraging machine learning in bioinformatics for peptide classification.

Future work includes tuning the model for higher accuracy, exploring other machine learning algorithms, and possibly integrating domain-specific knowledge through hybrid modeling approaches.
